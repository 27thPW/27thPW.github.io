This is a very very simple writer for writing text. It has pretty good readability, automatic titling, and saving using your browser's local storage. Check it out on my github.io site.

Things to do:
-local saving as plaintext w/o copy-pasting
-arbitrary font sizes & more rich formatting like super/subscript or strikethrough
-highlighting
-a different font, prolly
-permalinking & server-side storage (probably not, depending on how i'm feeling i guess)
-not written in html
-fixing glaring oversights tbd
